### A prototype dashboard

Messing around with Dash and AWS

## To deploy on AWS

* Zip the requirements, code and model up with any zipping thing
* Go to Elastic Beanstalk in your AWS console
* Create application
* Choose the appropriate python platform
* Upload your zipped code 
* Aaaaaway you go!
* Delete the application when you're done (unless you wanna maybe pay?)

## Debugging

* If you're getting 502 errors, check the logs (bar on the left hand side) Youll be able to see the errors there
* Amazing is picky about what your application file is called and the application objec in that file!
